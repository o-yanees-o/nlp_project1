# nlp_project1
My first NLP project 

MAJOR ROADBLOCK: My Twitter Dev account is extremely limited (perhaps blocked) so I will put this project aside for now. 
I will move over to another project

I am now a complete beginner to the ideas and practices of Machine Learning. I have read some theory -- that is all really. NLP I have heard is a major subject in machine learning, which I thought I did not have too much interest in. My feeling is that it is already super developped (but nowhere near total in some resects; thinking chatbots, translation) and marginal gains require massive effort. 
But, in pursuit of following the trailblazers and also as I have realized that perhaps knowing basic NLP methods may be very useful for data collection, I have decided to do a little beginners project in NLP. 
From here, I go

For this project, I have decided to generally start following https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/a-complete-guide-to-twitter-sentiment-analysis-part-one-8dd6d82118b3 -- actually among other sources. This one seems outdated
